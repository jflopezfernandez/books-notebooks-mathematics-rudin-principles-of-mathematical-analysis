\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem-4.15}
	If $\textbf{f}$ is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space $X$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$, then $\textbf{f}(X)$ is closed and bounded. Thus, $\textbf{f}$ is bounded.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem-4.16}
	Suppose $f$ is a continuous real function on a compact metric space $X$, and
	\begin{align}
	M &= \underset{p \in X}{\text{sup}} f(p), & m &= \underset{p \in X}{\text{inf}} f(p).
	\end{align}
	Then there exist points $p,q \in X$ such that $f(p) = M$ and $f(q) = m$.
\end{theorem}

\setcounter{theorem}{21}
\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem-4.22}
	If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, and if $E$ is a connected subset of $X$, then $f(E)$ is connected.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem-4.23}
	Let $f$ be a continuous real function on the interval $\left[ a, b \right]$. If $f(a) < f(b)$ and if $c$ is a number such that $f(a) < c < f(b)$, then there exists a point $x \in (a, b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.
