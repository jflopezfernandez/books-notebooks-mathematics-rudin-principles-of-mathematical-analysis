\begin{exercise}
	Prove that there is no rational number whose square is~$12$.
\end{exercise}

% I don't think it's necessary to suppose there exists a rational number whose square is 12.
Suppose there did exist some rational number $r$ such that its square was $12$. From the assumption that $r^2~=~12$, we deduce that $r~=~\sqrt{12}$, and therefore $r~=~\sqrt{4 \cdot 3}~\equiv~2\sqrt{3}$. We will show that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, and by Proposition~\ref{proposition-1.1.1} the product $2\sqrt{3}$ is as well.

\begin{proposition}
	The real number $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose to the contrary there exists some rational number $r$ such that its square is $3$. This implies the existence of some non-zero integers $m$ and $n$ such that $r=\frac{m}{n}$ and $\frac{m^2}{n^2}=3$. Since $m$ and $n$ are in reduced form, they cannot both be even.
	\newline\newline
	We thus have $m^2=3n^2$. ...
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	There is no rational number whose square is $12$.
\end{proposition}
