\begin{exercise}
	Prove that there is no rational number whose square is~$12$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proposition}
	There is no rational number whose square is $12$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $r$ be some real number such that $r^2 = 12$. Suppose $r$ was rational, such that there existed some non-zero integers $m$ and $n$ such that $r = \frac{m}{n}$ and $\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 12$. Solving for $m$, we get the following.
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{m^2}{n^2} &= 12 \\
	m^2 &= 12n^2 \\
	m^2 &= 3 \cdot 4n^2 \\
	m &= \sqrt{3} \cdot 2n
	\end{align*}
	Since $12$ is even, $12n^2$ must also be even. However, $m$ is clearly not even, as $\sqrt{3} \cdot 2n$ is not evenly divisible by $2$. This means that $m^2$ must be odd, in direct contradiction with our earlier assertion that $12n^2$ must be even. We conclude from this contradiction that there cannot exist a rational number whose square is $12$.
\end{proof}
