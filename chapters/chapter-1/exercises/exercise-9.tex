\begin{exercise}
	Suppose $z = a + bi$, $w = c + di$. Define $z < w$ if $a < c$ and also if $a = c$ but $b < d$. Prove that this turns the set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. (This type of order relation is called a \textit{dictionary order}, or \textit{lexicographic order}, for obvious reasons.) Does this ordered set have the least-upper-bound property?
