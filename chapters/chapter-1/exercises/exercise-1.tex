\begin{exercise}
	If $r$ is rational and $x$ is irrational, prove that $r + x$ and $rx$ are irrational.
\end{exercise}

We will proceed by proving the irrationality of the product $rx$ first, from which the irrationality of the sum $r + x$ will naturally follow.

\begin{proposition}
	For any rational number $r$ and irrational number $x$, the product $rx$ is irrational.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose to the contrary that the product $rx$ is rational, implying the existence of some integers $m$ and $n \neq 0$ such that $r = \frac{m}{n}$ and $rx = \frac{m}{n} \cdot x = \frac{mx}{n}$. If $rx$ was rational, we could multiply by $\frac{1}{r} = \frac{n}{m}$, giving us $\frac{mx}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{m} = x$. Since we have simply multiplied two (allegedly) rational numbers and the rational numbers are a field and thus closed under multiplication, the result must be a rational number. Since the result is $x$, and we began by supposing $x$ was irrational, we've arrived at our contradiction.
	
	The product of a rational number $r$ and an irrational number $x$ yields an irrational number $rx$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	For any rational number $r$ and irrational number $x$, the sum $r + x$ is irrational.
