\begin{exercise}
	Prove that the empty set is a subset of every set.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proposition}
	The empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$, is a subset of every set.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $A$ be an arbitrary set. In order to prove that the empty set is a subset of $A$, we must show that for any element $x$ in $\emptyset$, $x$ is also an element of $A$. Since --by definition-- the empty set contains no elements, this statement is vacuously true and thus not very interesting.
	\newline\newline
	Consider instead the contrapositive: for any element $x$, if $x$ is not an element of $A$, then $x$ is not an element of $\emptyset$. Again, since $\emptyset$ contains no elements, this statement is true for all elements $x \notin A$, as required.
\end{proof}
