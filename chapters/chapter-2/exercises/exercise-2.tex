\begin{exercise}
	A complex number $z$ is said to be \textit{algebraic} if there are integers $a_0,\ldots,a_n$, not all zero, such that
	\begin{equation*}
	a_0z^n + a_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}z + a_n = 0.
	\end{equation*}
	Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. \textit{Hint:} For every positive integer $N$ there are only finitely many equations with
	\begin{equation*}
	n + |a_0| + |a_1| + \cdots + |a_n| = N.
	\end{equation*}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proposition}
