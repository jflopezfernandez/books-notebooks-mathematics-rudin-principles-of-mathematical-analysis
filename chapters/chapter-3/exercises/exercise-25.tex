\begin{exercise}
	Let $X$ be the metric space whose points are the rational numbers, with the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. What is the completion of this space? (Compare Exercise 24.)
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	The completion of this space is the real numbers, within which the rational numbers are dense. In fact, one of the axiomatic constructions of the real numbers is precisely the completion of the rational numbers by the use of Cauchy sequences.
\end{solution}
