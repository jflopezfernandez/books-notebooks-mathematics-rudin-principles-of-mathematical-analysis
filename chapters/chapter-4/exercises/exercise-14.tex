\begin{exercise}
	Let $I = \left[ 0, 1 \right]$ be the closed unit interval. Suppose $f$ is a continuous mapping of $I$ into $I$. Prove that $f(x) = x$ for at least one $x \in I$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proposition}
	Let $I = \left[ 0, 1\right]$ be the closed unit interval and let $f : I \to I$ be a continuous function. There exists some $x \in I$ such that $f(x) = x$.
