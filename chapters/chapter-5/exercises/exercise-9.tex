\begin{exercise}
	Let $f$ be a continuous real function on $\mathbb{R}^1$, of which it is known that $f^\prime(x)$ exists for all $x \neq 0$ and that $f^\prime(x) \to 3$ as $x \to 0$. Does it follow that $f^\prime(0)$ exists?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
	If the left- and right-hand derivatives are both equal to $3$ as $x$ approaches zero, then $f^\prime(0)$ exists and is equal to $3$. However, the function $g(x) = 3 \left| x \right|$ is an example of a function whose derivative is defined for all $x \neq 0$ and whose right-hand derivative approaches $3$ as $x^+$ approaches zero. However, the derivative of $g(x)$ at $x = 0$ does not exist.
\end{solution}
