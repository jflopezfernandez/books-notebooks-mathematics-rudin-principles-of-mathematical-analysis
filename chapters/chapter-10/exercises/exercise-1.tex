\begin{exercise}
	Let $H$ be a compact convex set in $\mathbb{R}^k$, with nonempty interior. Let $f \in \mathscr{C} \left( H \right)$, put $f \left( \textbf{x} \right) = 0$ in the complement of $H$, and define $\int_H f$ as in Definition 10.3.
	\newline\newline
	Prove that $\int_H f$ is independent of the order in which the $k$ integrations are carried out. \textit{Hint:} Approximate $f$ by functions that are continuous on $\mathbb{R}^k$ and whose supports are in $H$, as was done in Example 10.4.
